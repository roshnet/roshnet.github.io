## Welcome to my space!

Hey there!
This page contains mostly me and the stuff that keeps me engaged.
Web series take a large part of my time, and so does programming.


### Python and me

Python was the third language I had the fortune of learning. Driven by its' simplicity, I soon realised that I was able to spend couple of couple of couple of hours in just a couple of hours. Such was the craze I had (and still have) for the language.

```markdown
 `# My initial code looked like`
  variable=5
  from something import *
 `# which at the end became`
 x = 5
 from something import first_thing
 from something import second_thing

 `# and the list of modifications went on. Hope it still goes the same way.`
```

Here's something about the awesome tool I used to create this stuff:

### Jekyll Themes

This site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/roshnet/roshnet.github.io/settings).

### Something I Made
The biggest solo project i did is [this one right here](http://askhfn.000webhostapp.com).
Took me over a couple of months, the biggest problem being migration.
Finally, I learnt a LOT from this, especially in web development.<br/>
PS: Do not take me to be a pro :)
