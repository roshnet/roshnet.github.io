Last Wednesday, folks from the community got a chance to attend a session by
Rahul Jha, a senior, and

The session was aimed at gaining deeper insights of the tech world, open source
in particular.

It started with a simple thing. We were asked to give simple thoughts on one of
the following three things - engineering, fun, and mentorship.

As it turned out, we had some great answers from the audience, which were discussed in
great depth.

Next series of topics was focused on contributing to open source softwares.
He shared with us some of his efforts during his journey in Google Summer of
Code 2017 and 2018, and also acquainted us with the know-hows of applying to an
organization in GSoC.


A key take away for me (and I believe, for pretty much all of us) was the habit of
frequent Googling, or if you say, DuckDuckGo-ing. I could've used the word "searching",
but that would tie up one end of this topic. We got to know about the differences in searching
using Google, and searching using one of it's alternative - DuckDuckGo, with regards to both privacy
and precision (precision of finding answers to tech-related questions).

The session concluded with a common, but powerful word of advice - not to give up.
We were prevised that contributing to open source softwares can be hard, but we were
also motivated to not give up until the goal yields.
