Hi, I'm Roshan, a student pursuing Electronics engineering from Aligarh Muslim University, India.
I'm excited about working on web-based projects, anywhere from creating web APIs to playing with images.

I'm a [Heartfulness](https://heartfulness.org) practitioner, figuring my way out to learn how to meditate
effectively.

In my free time, I browse about industrial tech. Most of my time goes in looking for someone on StackOverflow
I can help.


### Stuff I do

I work in Python, however, plan to switch to JavaScript for the web in near future; owing to it's industrial approach in
getting things done.

(EDIT): I'm working in Vue.js!

I've done things from application backend development, to creating APIs for my personal projects, and
creating responsive UIs from scratch using media queries.

I attempted [Google Summer of Code 2019](http://g.co/gsoc), but couldn't make it up to there.

I, along with my college folks, had the privilege to code as the team "Narcodes", which finished as first runner up in the
[Smart India Hackathon 2019](http://sih.gov.in) (software edition) held in Guwahati, India.

I also got selected for an internship as a web developer in the [SSGSA Non-Profit Organisation](http://ssgsa.us).


### Projects

One of my first projects was an attempt to develop a Quora-like platform to discuss meditation-based
Q/A, which is hosted [right here](https://askhfn.000webhostapp.com).

Another one (currently under active development) is [BlogState][blogstate].
This one basically allows users to blog right after [creating an account][blogstate-signup],
like they do on social media.
If you happen to be a coder, make sure to [take a crack at it](https://github.com/roshnet/blogstate).

Besides, there are other not-so-big projects that I do just to commit mistakes,
in order to get a solid understanding of the underlying concepts.

Please check my work [here](https://github.com/roshnet).


### Plans for the future

I'm a self-taught programmer, which has it's own pros and cons.
However, I wish to share the intuition I've made about some programming concepts
that I think beginners would have a hard time getting a grasp on. Looking forward
to writing about it on this blog someday :)

I'm growing interest in hardware programming and robotics, which made me order an
[Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc) the very next day I read about it.

I'm fascinated by the recent buildup in [machine learning][ml-definition], and
[deep learning][dl-definition]. I started working my way through, until I got the
feeling that ML/DL is definitely over rated. I am thus, continuing my pursuit of
making applications for the web.


### Set a meeting up!

I'd be glad if you offer me a coffee, and discuss ideas about code, aliens, and whatnot.
Or, if you've got this crazy idea that no one wants to hear, do feel free to contact me.
