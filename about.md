I'm Roshan Sharma, pursuing engineering in Electronics, from Aligarh Muslim University, India.
I love to work on software-based projects, anywhere from creating web APIs to playing with images.

I am deeply interested in motorsports - [MotoGP](https://motogp.com) and [Formula 1](https://formula1.com).
Videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLpb6k6afIM) get me working up when I think I'm done.
Though I'm not a big Hamilton-fan, I do play [F1 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuLvXypd7zg) whenever
I feel the need for <s>speed</s> focus.

In my free time, I browse about industrial tech. Most of my time goes in looking for someone on StackOverflow
I can help.


### Stuff I do

I mostly work in Python, however, plan to switch to JavaScript for the web in near future; owing to it's industrial approach in
getting things done.
I've done things from application backend development, to creating APIs for my personal projects, and
creating responsive UIs from scratch using media queries.

I attempted [Google Summer of Code 2019](http://g.co/gsoc), but couldn't make it up to there.

I, along with my college folks, had the privilege to code as the team "Narcodes", which finished as first runner up in the
[Smart India Hackathon 2019](http://sih.gov.in) (software edition) held in Guwahati, India.

I also got selected for an internship as a web developer in the [SSGSA Non-Profit Organisation](http://ssgsa.us).


### Projects

One of my first projects was an attempt to develop a Quora-like platform to discuss meditation-based
Q/A, which is hosted [right here](https://askhfn.000webhostapp.com).

Another one (currently under active development) is [BlogState][blogstate].
This one basically allows users to blog right after [creating an account][blogstate-signup],
like they do on social media.
If you happen to be a coder, make sure to [take a crack at it](https://github.com/roshnet/blogstate).

Besides, there are other not-so-big projects that I do just to commit mistakes,
in order to get a solid understanding of the underlying concepts.


### Plans for the future

I'm a self-taught programmer, which has it's own pros and cons.
However, I wish to share the intuition I've made about some programming concepts
that I think beginners would have a hard time getting a grasp on. Looking forward
to writing about it on this blog someday :)

I'm growing interest in hardware programming and robotics, which made me order an
[Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc) the very next day I read about it.

Also, the magics in [machine learning][ml-definition] and the mysteries of
[deep learning][dl-definition] keep me occupied enough to think about anything else.
Hope to get started after I complete the book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning][dl-book]
by [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/).


### Set a meeting up!

I'd be glad if you offer me a coffee, and discuss ideas about code, aliens, and whatnot.
